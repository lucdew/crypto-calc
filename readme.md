Crypto-calc is a "swiss army knife" like GUI that enables to perform some cryptographic operations on small amount of data

It is based on electron and should run on Windows,Mac,Linux (only tested on Windows)

It is still in development and should not be used for production.

So far it supports :
* Symmetric encryption/decryption (AES,DES,3DES) with different padding PKCS5/7 and ISO-7816-4
